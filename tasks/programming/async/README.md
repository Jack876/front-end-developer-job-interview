# Async

## Time

3-10 min.


## Task

`index.js` asynchronously reads two directories and returns nothing.

Fix the script so it will return **one sorted** array with files from directories `dir/1` and `dir/2`. Ignore files with names that are not numbers.

E.g.:

```bash
$ node index.js
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
```

What if we need to add one more directory? Two?
